# Halloween-Hangman

:skull: "Halloween Hangman" is a game based on the original game "Hangman", but with a halloween theme (halloween categories, photos and animations).
<br>
:skull: The game was created using WPF (.NET), and it serves as my first project using MVVM arhitectural pattern.

# The Game
## Log-In
The game starts with a "Log-In" view, where you can:
<br>
- Select a "survivor" (player) to play with
- Add and remove survivors
- Change the survivor's profile picture
## Survivor Game
This view opens after you hit "Play" in the Log-In view
Here you can:
- Create a new game
- Load a saved game
- See your statistics
## Hangman
This view is the game view, where you can play the game.
